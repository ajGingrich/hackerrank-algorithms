Consider an undirected graph consisting of *n* nodes where each node is labeled from **1** to   *n*and the edge between any two nodes is always of length **6**. We define node *s* to be the starting position for a BFS.

Given *q* queries in the form of a graph and some starting node, *s*, perform each query by calculating the shortest distance from starting node *s* to all the other nodes in the graph. Then print a single line of *n* - 1 space-separated integers listing node 's shortest distance to each of the *n* - 1 other nodes (ordered sequentially by node number); if *s* is disconnected from a node, print **-1** as the distance to that node.

#### Input Format

The first line contains an integer, *q*, denoting the number of queries. The subsequent lines describe each query in the following format:

* The first line contains two space-separated integers describing the respective values of *n* (the number of nodes) and *m* (the number of edges) in the graph.
* Each line *i* of the *m* subsequent lines contains two space-separated integers,  *u* and *v*, describing an edge connecting node *u* to node *v*.
* The last line contains a single integer, *s*, denoting the index of the starting node.

#### Constraints

* 1 ≤ *q* ≤ 10
* 2 ≤ *n* ≤ 1000
* 1 ≤ *m* ≤ *(n x (n -1))/2*
* 1 ≤ *u, v, s* ≤ n

#### Output Format

For each of the *q* queries, print a single line of *n* -1 space-separated integers denoting the shortest distances to each of the *n* - 1 other nodes from starting position . These distances should be listed sequentially by node number (i.e., **1**, **2**, ..., *n*), but *should not* include node *s*. If some node is unreachable from *s*, print **-1** as the distance to that node.

#### Sample Input

    2
    4 2
    1 2
    1 3
    1
    3 1
    2 3
    2

#### Sample Output

    6 6 -1
    -1 6

#### Explanation

We perform the following two queries:

1. The given graph can be represented as: 

![graph1](https://s3.amazonaws.com/hr-challenge-images/5580/1470939600-bcdb0816eb-BFS.png)

where our *start* node, *s*, is node **1**. The shortest distances from *s* to the other nodes are one edge to node **3**, one edge to node **4**, and an infinite distance to node  (which it's not connected to). We then print node 's distance to nodes **2**, **3**, and **4** (respectively) as a single line of space-separated integers: `6 6 -1`.

2. The given graph can be represented as: 

![graph2](https://s3.amazonaws.com/hr-challenge-images/5580/1470940326-10109a7d5c-BFS2.png)

where our *start* node, *s*, is node **2**. There is only one edge here, so node **1** is unreachable from node **2** and node **3** has one edge connecting it to node **2**. We then print node **2**'s distance to nodes **1** and **3** (respectively) as a single line of space-separated integers: `-1 6`.

**Note:** Recall that the actual length of each edge is **6**, and we print **-1** as the distance to any node that's unreachable from *s*.
