A linked list is said to contain a *cycle* if any node is visited more than once while traversing the list.

Complete the function provided in the editor below. It has one parameter: a pointer to a *Node* object named that points to the head of a linked list. Your function must return a boolean denoting whether or not there *is* a cycle in the list. If there is a cycle, return *true*; otherwise, return false.

**Note**: If the list is empty, *head*  will be *null*.

#### Input Format

Our hidden code checker passes the appropriate argument to your function. You are not responsible for reading any input from stdin.

#### Constraints

* 1 ≤ *list size* ≤ 100

#### Output Format

If the list contains a cycle, your function must return *true*. If the list *does not* contain a *cycle*, it must return *false*. The binary integer corresponding to the boolean value returned by your function is printed to stdout by our hidden code checker.

#### Sample Input

The following linked lists are passed as arguments to your function

#### Sample Output

    0
    1

#### Explanation

The first list has no cycle, so we return *false* and the hidden code checker prints **0** to stdout.
The second list has a cycle, so we return *true* and the hidden code checker prints **1** to stdout.
