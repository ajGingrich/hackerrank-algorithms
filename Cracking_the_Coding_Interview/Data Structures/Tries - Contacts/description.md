We're going to make our own *Contacts* application! The application must perform two types of operations:

1. `add name`, where *name* is a string denoting a contact name. This must store *name* as a new contact in the application.
2. `find partial`, where *partial* is a string denoting a partial name to search the application for. It must count the number of contacts starting with *partial* and print the count on a new line.

Given *n* sequential *add* and *find* operations, perform each operation in order.

#### Input Format

The first line contains a single integer, *n*, denoting the number of operations to perform. 
Each line *i* of the *n* subsequent lines contains an operation in one of the two forms defined above.

#### Constraints

* 1 ≤ *n* ≤ 10<sup>5</sup>
* 1 ≤ |*name*| ≤ 21
* 1 ≤ |*partial*| ≤ 21
* It is guaranteed that *name* and *partial* contain lowercase English letters only.
* The input doesn't have any duplicate *name* for the *add** operation.

#### Output Format

For each `find partial` operation, print the number of contact names starting with *partial* on a new line.

#### Sample Input

    4
    add hack
    add hackerrank
    find hac
    find hak

#### Sample Output

    2
    0

#### Explanation

We perform the following sequence of operations:

1. Add a contact named `hack`.
2. Add a contact named `hackerrank`.
3. Find and print the number of contact names beginning with `hac`. There are currently two contact names in the application and both of them start with `hac`, so we print **2** on a new line.
4. Find and print the number of contact names beginning with `hak`. There are currently two contact names in the application but neither of them start with `hak`, so we print **0** on a new line.
